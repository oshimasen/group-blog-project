        <h1 class="title">Hiragana</h1>
        <h2 class="symbol">あ</h2>
        <p>
            Hiragana is a phonetic script consisting of 46 basic characters, 
            each representing a distinct sound in the Japanese language. 
            It is used for native Japanese words, particles, and grammatical elements. 
            Hiragana characters are more rounded and flowing, which makes them suitable for expressing softer tones in writing. 
            This script is essential for reading and writing in Japanese, especially for children and learners.

        <h1 class="title">Katakana</h1>
        <h2 class="symbol">ア</h2>
        <p>
            Katakana is another phonetic script with 46 basic characters, 
            each corresponding to a specific sound like Hiragana. 
            It is primarily used for foreign loanwords, technical terms, 
            and onomatopoeia. Katakana characters are more angular and rigid, 
            giving them a distinct, sharp appearance compared to Hiragana. 
            This script helps distinguish non-native words and emphasizes foreign origins in Japanese texts.

        <h1 class="title">Kanji</h1>
        <h2 class="symbol">始</h2>
        <p>
            Kanji are logographic characters borrowed from Chinese, 
            each representing a particular meaning and often multiple pronunciations. 
            There are thousands of Kanji characters, but a core set is commonly used in everyday writing. 
            Kanji can convey complex ideas and concepts with a single character, adding depth and precision to the language. 
            Mastery of Kanji is crucial for reading and writing at an advanced level in Japanese.
